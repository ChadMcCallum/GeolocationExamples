GeolocationExamples
===================

Code from HTML5 talk I did at MosoConf.

This includes a visual studio solution and project for an empty web site, which you can run by simply hitting F5.  

If you don't have visual studio open, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser, but be aware some browsers won't let you access the Geolocation API if you're running from the filesystem for security reasons.
